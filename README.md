## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Rust** (latest stable)
- **Flutter** (3.0+)
- **Mopro CLI** (0.1.0)
- **iOS/Android** development environment

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Blocsoc-iitr/Nymph.git
   cd Nymph
   ```

2. **Install Mopro CLI**
   ```bash
   cargo install mopro-cli@0.1.0
   ```

3. **Build Native Bindings (if not already)**
   ```bash
   # For iOS
   mopro build  # Select: aarch64-apple-ios
   
   # For Android (enable android-compat in Cargo.toml first)
   mopro build  # Select: aarch64-linux-android
   ```

4. **Update Flutter Bindings**
   ```bash
   cp -r MoproiOSBindings flutter/mopro_flutter_plugin/ios && \
   cp -r MoproAndroidBindings/uniffi flutter/mopro_flutter_plugin/android/src/main/kotlin && \
   cp -r MoproAndroidBindings/jniLibs flutter/mopro_flutter_plugin/android/src/main
   ```

5. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   cd flutter
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

### üîß Configuration

#### Android Compatibility
Enable Android support in `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
noir = { git = "https://github.com/zkmopro/noir-rs", features = ["barretenberg", "android-compat"] }
```

#### Firebase Setup
1. Add your `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)
2. Configure Firebase Authentication
3. Set up your project's Firebase console

## üîê Security & Privacy

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture
- **No Identity Storage**: Your real identity is never stored
- **Ephemeral Keys**: Temporary authentication keys that expire
- **Proof-Based Verification**: Cryptographic proof of membership
- **Organizational Isolation**: Secure internal communication channels

### Data Protection
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages are encrypted in transit
- **No Metadata Collection**: We don't track your usage patterns
- **Local Key Management**: Keys stored securely on your device
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Ephemeral data is automatically purged
